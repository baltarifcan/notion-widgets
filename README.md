# My Notion widget
This repository contains some widgets I personally use in Notion.

## Percentage
This widget shows what percentage of the current year has been left behind. You can customize some of the styles with queries.

[Example with queries](https://baltarifcan.github.io/notion-widgets/percentage.html?bg=191919&outer=252525&inner=fe4358&font=monospace&size=25&height=100)
